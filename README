This repository contains the subprograms for exploring C# features and syntax.
The main program code can be found in the Program.cs file.

The subprogams available are the following:
1. DataTypes
        This subprogram shows common data types and built-in methods to modify the variables. 
2. ActivitySearch
        This subprogram shows the locally optimal choice of activities among the pile. 
3. MinimumEditDistance
        This subprogram returns the value of the minimum steps needed to edit a word to another word. 
4. StackLinkedList
        This subprogram stores a value in a stack order by using a linked list structure. 
5. BinarySearch
        This subprogram efficiently searches the position of a value in an array.
6. SelectionSort
        This subprogram sorts an array by swapping the leftmost value 
        covered with the smallest data among the remaining values.
7. BubbleSort
        This subprogram sorts an array by swapping from left to right of array the two values adjacent to each other.
8. DataTypes2
        This subprogram shows another set of data types such as records, enums, struct, String array, and Object array. 
        It also has the type scoping method to show that C# is a statically typed language, 
        and a type safe method to show that non-generic collections impose an error-prone compilation in runtime. 
        
        
To access the subprograms, do the following:
1. Place the C# files in the same folder or directory
2. Open any IDE for C# that can run on a terminal (In my case, I used Visual Studio Code)
3. Run the program via the available terminal (In my case with Visual Studio Code, I typed dotnet run in the powershell terminal)
